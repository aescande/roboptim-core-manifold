- In manifold-desc, one should define the appropriated structs for all the
  remaining elementary manifolds.

- In DescriptiveWrapper, one should ideally create a default private
  constructor as the programmer should never have to instantiate it directly.

- In FunctionOnManifold, one should make the ROBOPTIM_DIFFERENTIABLE_FWD_DECS
  non automatic, and using boost::enable_if therefore make it possible to
  define Manifolds wrapping for non differentiable types of function, or more
  specific ones (linear functions for example).
